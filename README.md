# Refresh a Tableau Hyper extract automatically

## How it works
This code will allow you to update or replace an existing tableau .hyper data file - without needing to manually open up a workbook and refresh the extract.

Any Tableau workbooks already connected to the datafile will then automatically have updated data.

## Installing dependencies
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
